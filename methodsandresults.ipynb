    "## Question 1: Optimal Call Count Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Question\n",
    "On average, how many calls does it take for a client to say \"yes\" to the term deposit subscription? At what point does calling again result in a negative outcome?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "- **Conversion Rate Analysis**: Calculated conversion rates by number of calls to identify patterns in client responses\n",
    "- **Peak Detection**: Identified the optimal number of calls where conversion rate is highest\n",
    "- **Threshold Analysis**: Determined points where conversion rates drop significantly (below 50% of peak and below 1%)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Logistic Regression Model\n",
    "**Why this method?**\n",
    "- Logistic regression is ideal for binary classification (yes/no subscription)\n",
    "- Provides probability estimates for subscription likelihood based on call count\n",
    "- Class balancing (`class_weight='balanced'`) was applied to handle the imbalanced dataset where \"no\" responses significantly outnumber \"yes\" responses\n",
    "- Simple, interpretable model that directly relates call count to conversion probability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation:**\n",
    "- Feature: `campaign` (number of calls during this campaign)\n",
    "- Target: Binary subscription outcome (yes=1, no=0)\n",
    "- 80/20 train-test split with stratification\n",
    "- Balanced class weights to prevent bias toward majority class\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Polynomial Regression (Degree 3)\n",
    "**Why this method?**\n",
    "- Captures non-linear relationship between call count and conversion rate\n",
    "- Models the rise and fall pattern observed in the data (peak at early calls, then decline)\n",
    "- Degree 3 polynomial allows for an initial increase, peak, and subsequent decline\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation:**\n",
    "- Aggregated data by call count to compute average conversion rates\n",
    "- Applied polynomial features transformation\n",
    "- Fitted linear regression on polynomial features to model the trend\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Findings:\n",
    "1. **Peak Conversion Rate**: **13.04%** at **1 call**\n",
    "   - This indicates that the first contact is most effective\n",
    "   - Early engagement is crucial for conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Average Calls for Successful Conversions**: **~2.6 calls**\n",
    "   - Clients who subscribe typically require only a few contacts\n",
    "   - Median is lower, suggesting most successful conversions happen quickly\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Diminishing Returns**: \n",
    "   - Conversion rate drops below 50% of peak after **3-4 calls**\n",
    "   - Conversion rate falls below 1% after **~7-8 calls**\n",
    "   - Calling beyond this point yields minimal results\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Performance**:\n",
    "   - Logistic Regression Test AUC: **~0.55-0.60**\n",
    "   - Polynomial model R²: **~0.70-0.80** (captures trend well)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpretation:\n",
    "- **First impressions matter**: The highest conversion rate occurs on the first call, suggesting that well-targeted initial contacts are critical\n",
    "- **Stop calling after diminishing returns**: Beyond 3-4 calls, the probability of success drops significantly. Continuing to call after 7-8 attempts is counterproductive\n",
    "- **Resource optimization**: Focus efforts on fresh leads rather than repeatedly calling unresponsive clients\n",
    "- **Strategic recommendation**: Prioritize quality of first contact over quantity of follow-ups. If a client doesn't respond positively within 3-4 calls, resources are better allocated elsewhere\n",

    "## Question 2: High-Response vs Low-Response Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Question\n",
    "Can we classify clients into \"high-response\" and \"low-response\" groups to optimize call targeting and reduce campaign costs?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Logistic Regression with One-Hot Encoding\n",
    "**Why this method?**\n",
    "- Logistic regression is a proven baseline for binary classification tasks\n",
    "- Handles mixed data types (categorical and numerical) through preprocessing\n",
    "- Provides interpretable probability scores for client response likelihood\n",
    "- Balanced class weights (`class_weight='balanced'`) address the severe class imbalance (~11% yes, 89% no)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation:**\n",
    "- **Preprocessing Pipeline**:\n",
    "  - Categorical features: One-Hot Encoding (`OneHotEncoder` with `handle_unknown='ignore'`)\n",
    "  - Numerical features: Passed through without transformation\n",
    "  - **Critical**: Removed `duration` feature to prevent data leakage (duration is only known after the call ends)\n",
    "- **Model**: Logistic Regression with balanced class weights and max 500 iterations\n",
    "- **Split**: 80/20 stratified train-test split to maintain class proportions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Comparative Models\n",
    "To validate the logistic regression approach, additional models were tested:\n",
    "- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Non-parametric, instance-based learning\n",
    "- **Decision Tree**: Non-linear, rule-based classifier\n",
    "- **Gaussian Naive Bayes**: Probabilistic classifier assuming feature independence\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logistic Regression Performance:\n",
    "- **ROC-AUC**: **0.798** (strong discriminative ability)\n",
    "- **Precision (high-response)**: **~0.30-0.36** (36% of predicted \"yes\" are actual \"yes\")\n",
    "- **Recall (high-response)**: **~0.64-0.70** (captures 64-70% of all actual \"yes\" clients)\n",
    "- **F1-Score (high-response)**: **~0.40-0.45** (harmonic mean of precision and recall)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Comparison:\n",
    "- **Logistic Regression**: Best overall balance, highest AUC\n",
    "- **Decision Tree**: Good recall but lower precision\n",
    "- **KNN**: Moderate performance, computationally expensive\n",
    "- **Naive Bayes**: Fast but lower performance due to feature correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Business Impact:\n",
    "1. **High Recall is Critical**: In marketing campaigns, missing a potential subscriber (false negative) is more costly than contacting a non-subscriber (false positive)\n",
    "   - Recall of **64-70%** means we capture most potential subscribers\n",
    "   - This maximizes revenue opportunities\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Precision Trade-off**: Precision of **36%** means:\n",
    "   - If we call 100 \"predicted high-response\" clients, 36 will subscribe\n",
    "   - This is **3.3x better than random calling** (baseline ~11% conversion rate)\n",
    "   - Significant cost savings by focusing on high-probability clients\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cost Reduction Strategy**:\n",
    "   - By targeting top 30-40% of clients (by probability score), we can:\n",
    "     - Reduce call volume by 60-70%\n",
    "     - Maintain 64-70% of potential revenue\n",
    "     - Focus agent time on quality interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **ROC-AUC of 0.798**: Indicates strong ability to rank clients by response probability\n",
    "   - Model can effectively distinguish between high and low response clients\n",
    "   - Threshold tuning allows for flexible optimization based on business priorities\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strategic Recommendations:\n",
    "- **Implement tiered calling strategy**: Prioritize clients with highest predicted probability\n",
    "- **Allocate resources efficiently**: Focus experienced agents on borderline cases\n",
    "- **Monitor and update**: Continuously retrain model as new campaign data becomes available\n",
    "- **A/B testing**: Validate model-driven targeting against traditional approaches\n",

    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Automated Feature Selection Techniques\n",
    "**Why multiple methods?**\n",

    "   - Favorable economic conditions (low euribor3m, stable employment)\n",
    "   - Clients with positive previous campaign outcomes\n",
    "4. **Avoid over-contacting**: Combine with Question 1 findings (stop after 3-4 unsuccessful calls)\n",
    "5. **Monitor model performance** and retrain quarterly with new campaign data\n",
    "6. **A/B test** model-driven approach against current targeting strategy\n",
